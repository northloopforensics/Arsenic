Arsenic is a mobile triage tool designed for iOS and Android devices. Key features include secure backup creation, data parsing with timezone awareness, advanced photo classification using scene taxonomy, and detailed analysis of communications data (SMS, call history, app interactions). 

Arsenic provides investigators with intuitive visualization of device contents through customizable tables and responsive image galleries, making device data more accessible. The application extracts critical data including contacts, browsing history, app permissions, data usage patterns, and installed applications, presenting them in a searchable, sortable interface. 

CSV reports are generated during the triage process allowing for further analysis and review. 

The focus of this project is allowing for the speedy review of basic artifacts on consensual searches, and reducing unnecessary property seizures.
